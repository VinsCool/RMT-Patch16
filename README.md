# RMT-Patch16
Experimental Raster Music Tracker driver patch.

Original code by Raster/C.P.U., with few additions by Analmux for the Patch 8 hack.
Patch 16 experimental version by me (VinsCool).


This driver version is mostly a bunch of hacks I have come up using my very poor coding skills.
It will be improved further in the near future.
A new RMT version will come bundled with this patched driver, but there are plans to allow multiple versions.
No ETA yet for the main RMT program update.


My Unofficial RMT versions can be found over my Atari Age release thread:

Sources will be public... one day.
I am waiting for the permission to publish them, so please be patient.
In the meantime, I will post new stand alone versions occasionally, and try to keep the patched driver updated as well.
