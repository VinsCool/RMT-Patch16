# RMT-Patch16
Experimental Raster Music Tracker driver patch.

Original code by Raster/C.P.U.

Based on the changes by Analmux for his RMT Patch 8 driver hack.

Patch 16 is an experimental version by me (VinsCool), featuring a lot of ambitious ideas, and many poor attempts at making them possible.


This driver version is mostly a bunch of hacks I originally have thrown together just for fun, the goal was to get more tuning tables for many POKEY Modes and Distortions.

Since then, there have been multiple changes deep inside the RMT driver code, the point of becoming its own thing now.

The reason behind this is mainly to prove what can be done... And also because I WANT to actually be able to do these things when I make some music!

There is some reverse engineered code, and, if it was not reverse engineered, the code was recreated to achieve the best possible results of an idea.

The reverse engineered code is also not 100% identical to the original, since I actually had to guess what certain things did, and only loosely followed them.

Many of the changes were specifically made to my liking and/or personal use, but still remain fully functional, and behave almost exactly like the original.

Things will hopefully be improved further in the near future...

The patched driver version is currently bundled with my Unofficial RMT fork, which can be found over my Atari Age release thread:

The full RMT tracker sources will hopefullly be public... one day... I hope...

I am waiting for the permission to publish them, so please be patient.

Trust me, I really want to share all of my changes with the complete sources, but I am currently stuck in limbo, and I would feel bad to leak anything without the permission for it...

In the meantime, I will post new stand alone versions occasionally, and maintain the patched driver updated as well.

Enjoy.
