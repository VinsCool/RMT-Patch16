# RMT-Patch16
Experimental Raster Music Tracker driver patch.

Original code by Raster/C.P.U., with few additions by Analmux for the Patch 8 hack.
Patch 16 experimental version by me (VinsCool).


This driver version is mostly a bunch of hacks I have come up using my very poor coding skills.
It will be improved further in the near future.
A new RMT version will come bundled with this patched driver, but there are plans to allow multiple versions.
No ETA yet for the main RMT program update.
